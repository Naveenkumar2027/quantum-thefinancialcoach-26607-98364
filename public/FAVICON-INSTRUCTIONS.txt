Place the new favicon image you provided in this folder and name it `favicon.png`.
This project expects the favicon at `/favicon.png` and `index.html` has been updated to reference it.

Recommended sizes: 32x32 or 48x48 PNG. Modern browsers will accept larger sizes (e.g., 512x512) and scale down as needed.

If you want to replace the existing ICO instead, you can also convert the PNG to favicon.ico and overwrite `favicon.ico`.

After adding the file, reload the dev server and clear the browser cache (or open an incognito window) to see the new favicon.
